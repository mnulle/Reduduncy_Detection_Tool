* README file for RIPPS

== Source Code Overview

 - RIPPS_Support.cc	: Mapping of module and object names for core of ScaleBox
 - RIPPS_Monitor.cc : Monitor for the core of RIPPS operations
 

Tags to denote packet tap
  WAN or External			External side
  MonitorLAN or Internal   	Internal monitor host side
 
 
 
Settings - RIPPS Monitor

monitorInterval		Time between re-validation of hosts (in seconds)

======================================
<monitorInterval>

The default time in seconds between monitor points for a particular 
host following a successful resolution of the medium connection type.  

Default Value = 30 seconds

======================================

Wed - List
  Need to get a successful run of non-slicing working
     Take a connection on the Mac mini from start to finish
        Connection + Connection Summary

Thurs - List
  Need to get a successful run w/RIPPS
     Take a connection on the Mac mini from start to finish
     Take a connection on the Lenovo from start to finish

Friday - List
  Get all slides printed
  Run demo setup and validate to make sure it will work with NGW100
        
Saturday
  Handle any slippage but in general - work on viewer
  
Sunday
  No real time until evening (?)
  
Monday
  Traveling to Phoenix
  Validate demo in room to web server on Mac PowerBook        
        
Task List for INFOCOM Demo

 -> Improved Java GUI functionality
 	  To be done later (always add / mock up as necessary in flight if we have to)
 	  
 -> Host-wise stat reporting via the normal stat operations
     -> Individual RTTs is going to be tricky on the NGW - ignore for nwo
     -> Bulk reporting is worthwhile of summarized connections for RTT
     
    RIPPS_Connection		All but linkage to list of monitor packets
    RIPPS_ConnSummary		None - linkage present from host
    
 -> Bug stomping
  	 -> Seg fault - figure out where it is
  	 
 -> Ability to turn RIPPS on and off but still monitor
     -> Optional: Ability to turn on and off while running live
     -> Need
          - Ability to turn slicing off and still capture data
              Use that as a start point for Wednesday to work from and get all other
                statistics going 
     
 -> Hard filters
     -> Do not pass through streaming statistic info thinking it is for the passthrough
     -> Do a hard filter at RIPPS which will cover both in/out packets due to its taps
     	 -> Squelch all 10.0.0.1 for the LAN-side IP
     -> SSH traffic falls into a similar boat
          - Hard code a specific IP or IPs to ignore for all operations
          - Toss that into RIPPS to gobble the packets
