Fast Mobile Network Characterization Tool

Premise:

Divine using in-band techniques performance bottlenecks
with respect to the last-mile wireless links and next-to-last
mile broadband links.


How It Works:

The Fast Mobile Network Characterization tool builds on prior work
at the University of Notre Dame with RIPPS to use similar 
packet slicing / rearrangement to instrument the last and next-to-last
mile wireless links.  The tool itself draws its inspiration from
TCP Sting by Savage in the late 90's.  In short, we slice typical
TCP payloads into smaller payload slices and then rearrange the first
slice to the end to force multiple TCP acknowledgements.

The end result is that we can effectively squeeze rapid fire
acknowledgments out of unmodified TCP hosts using minimal bandwidth
and consuming only a minimal amount of time.  
  
To illustrate, consider a normal TCP flow consisting of nearly full
MSS (Maximum Segment Size) payloads approaching 1460 bytes.  Normally,
one would send the packets in order while obeying normal TCP slow
start congestion window growth (CWND).  

CWND = 1 packet
	Send 1460 to client
		Ack from client
CWND = 2 packets
	Send 1460 to client
	Send 1460 to client
		Ack from client for 2 data packets
CWND = 4 packets
	Send 1460 to client
	Send 1460 to client
	Send 1460 to client
	Send 1460 to client
