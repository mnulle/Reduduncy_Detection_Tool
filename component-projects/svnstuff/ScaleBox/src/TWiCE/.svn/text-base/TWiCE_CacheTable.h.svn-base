// The short gap where we might be able to get away with holding for OWB-like grouping iff
//  we are at the last hop on a cellular or wireless network.  This is probably pushing it and would
//  need to be tuned.  There is a good chance though that this occurs naturally by virtue of normal
//  queuing and no artificiality is necessary
//
//   Definition: 50 ms or less between a cache hit
#define TWICE_CACHEHIT_GAP_SHORT		50000

// The short max is at the bleeding edge for say a cellular network where queuing might still lead
//  us to an OWB-like type of effect.  We could never inject artificial queuing for this long but
//  it could exist naturally in the queue backlog such as with wireless.  Our original 802.11 paper
//  pushed close to this envelope

#define TWICE_CACHEHIT_GAP_SHORT_MAX		100000		// 100 ms between the hits

// The medium hit is where packet caching (RE) work tends to shine.  The medium min gap refers to
//  a general LTE-ish setting where the phone caches 10MB of data with a net rate of 30 Mb/s.  Taking
//  the back of the envelope calculations, that works out to roughly 2.5 seconds worth of full-sized
//  packets.  Obviously, that is a bit oversimplifying it but this gives us an indication of the lower
//  end of how tight we could set the downstream cache and still have a reasonable chance of success
//
// Note that this works out based on our experiments to roughly 4350 packets, estimate only
//
//   Definition: 2.5 seconds or less between a cache hit
#define TWICE_CACHEHIT_GAP_MEDIUM_MIN		2500000

// The medium hit refers to cases where the entry has stayed viable even for its first hit in the cache
//  table.  Basically, this is not OWB-friendly traffic but it is traffic that is seeing lots of hits.
//  This is prime wireless packet caching traffic and the most likely setting for the cache
//
