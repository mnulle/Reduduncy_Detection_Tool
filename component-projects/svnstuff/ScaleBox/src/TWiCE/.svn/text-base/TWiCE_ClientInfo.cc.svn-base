 * TWiCE: Transparent Wireless Capacity Enhancement
 **********************************************************
 * TWiCE is an extension to the ScaleBox code that focuses
 * on improvements to wireless capacity by the clever removal
 * of redundant content.
 *
 * Inspiration for TWiCE is drawn from results observed as
 * part of the NetSense cell phone study.  TWiCE is currently
 * being modernized as Proximity Secure Mixing (PSM).
 *
 * For additional information, please visit the NetScale
 * laboratory webpage at:

 *
 * PI:       Dr. Aaron Striegel    striegel@nd.edu
 *
 * Students: Xueheng Hu			   xhu2@nd.edu
 *
 * Prior students that contributed to the precursors to TWiCE
 * and PSM include Dave Salyers, Yingxin Jiang, and Xiaolong Li.
 *
 ************************************************************
 * Support for the development of TWiCE was drawn in part from
 * sources including the National Science Foundation, Sprint,
 * Alcatel-Lucent, and the University of Notre Dame.
